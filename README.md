ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§

Welcome to Lhammai! This project helps you build your own personal AI chatbot. Think of it like ChatGPT, Gemini, or
Claude, but youâ€™re in charge. You get full control and your privacy is protected.

The name Lhammai comes from "[Lhammas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhammas),"
[Noldorin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin#Creation) for "account of tongues", a work of fictional
sociolinguistics, written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937.

In short, Lhammai lets you:
- Create your own AI chatbot.
- Keep all your data private.
- Access your AI securely from anywhere using a VPN.
