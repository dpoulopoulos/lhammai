Lhammai documentation
=====================

Welcome to Lhammai! This project helps you build your own personal AI chatbot. Think of it like
ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, but you're in charge. You get full control and your privacy is
protected.

The name Lhammai comes from "`Lhammas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhammas>`_,"
`Noldorin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin#Creation>`_ for "account of tongues", a work of
fictional sociolinguistics, written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937.

In short, Lhammai lets you:

* Create your own AI chatbot.
* Keep all your data private.
* Access your AI securely from anywhere using a VPN.
